### ABOUT
In an electronic version of the word guessing game Hangman, participants use letter suggestions to try and solve a hidden word. Usually, a randomly chosen word that is represented by a string of dashes for each letter appears at the start of the game. As players guess, the word's proper letters are exposed, while their wrong guesses help to gradually draw a hangman figure. When the word is correctly guessed or the hangman is entirely drawn, which indicates a loss, the game is over. The gallows and letter displays, among other visual components, give users an interactive and interesting interface experience.

### PREREQUISITE
- Software and Tools
   - Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed. You can download it from the [Visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) website.
     The Community Edition is free and should suffice for this project.
   - Python Development Workload in Visual Studio: During the installation (or modification, if already installed) of Visual Studio,
     select the Python development workload. This includes the Python runtime and necessary tools to develop Python applications.
   - Python Interpreter: While the Python development workload in Visual Studio typically installs a Python interpreter,
      you can also use an existing installation of Python on your system.
   - Pygame Library: Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Install it using pip (Python's package installer)
     by running pip install pygame in the command line or terminal.
     
- Learning Resources
  - Pygame Documentation: Essential for understanding the functions and modules in Pygame.
  - Visual Studio Python Documentation: Helpful for leveraging Visual Studio's features for Python development.
