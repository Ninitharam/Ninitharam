### ABOUT
In an electronic version of the word guessing game Hangman, participants use letter suggestions to try and solve a hidden word. Usually, a randomly chosen word that is represented by a string of dashes for each letter appears at the start of the game. As players guess, the word's proper letters are exposed, while their wrong guesses help to gradually draw a hangman figure. When the word is correctly guessed or the hangman is entirely drawn, which indicates a loss, the game is over. The gallows and letter displays, among other visual components, give users an interactive and interesting interface experience.

### PREREQUISITE
- Software and Tools
   - Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed. You can download it from the [Visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) website.
     The Community Edition is free and should suffice for this project.
   - Python Development Workload in Visual Studio: During the installation (or modification, if already installed) of Visual Studio,
     select the Python development workload. This includes the Python runtime and necessary tools to develop Python applications.
   - Python Interpreter: While the Python development workload in Visual Studio typically installs a Python interpreter,
      you can also use an existing installation of Python on your system.
   - Pygame Library: Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Install it using pip (Python's package installer)
     by running pip install pygame in the command line or terminal.
     
- Learning Resources
  - Pygame Documentation: Essential for understanding the functions and modules in Pygame.
  - Visual Studio Python Documentation: Helpful for leveraging Visual Studio's features for Python development.

### BUILD MANAGEMENT
### UNIT TESTS
### IDE 
+ Visual Studio Code
  
### Favourite Shortcut Keys

+ F5 (Start Debugging) - Handy for quickly refactoring code, which is useful when iterating on game logic.

+ Ctrl + Shift + B (Build Solution) - Essential for running  Hangman game to test changes as I develop.

+ Ctrl + Space (IntelliSense) - Quickly builds the game to check for compile-time errors.

+ F9 (Toggle Breakpoint) - Offers code completion suggestions which are useful when coding game logic.

+ F12 (Go To Definition) - Extremely helpful for debugging game logic, like checking conditions for winning or losing.

+ Ctrl + - (Navigate Backwards) / Ctrl + Shift + - (Navigate Forwards) - Find where a specific method or variable is used throughout the game code.

+ Ctrl + Shift + F (Find in Files) - Quickly find and jump to any file or symbol in the project.

+ Ctrl + K, Ctrl + D (Format Document) - Quickly delete lines of code.

+ Alt + Enter (Full Screen) - Format game code to make it more readable and maintain a consistent coding style.

+ Ctrl + Z (Undo) / Ctrl + Y (Redo) - Focus on coding without distractions.

### FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
- only final data structures
- (mostly) side-effect-free functions
- the use of higher-order functions
- functions as parameters and return values
- use closures / anonymous functions
