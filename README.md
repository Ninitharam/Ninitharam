# HANGMAN GAME
In an electronic version of the word guessing game Hangman, participants use letter suggestions to try and solve a hidden word. Usually, a randomly chosen word that is represented by a string of dashes for each letter appears at the start of the game. As players guess, the word's proper letters are exposed, while their wrong guesses help to gradually draw a hangman figure. When the word is correctly guessed or the hangman is entirely drawn, which indicates a loss, the game is over. The gallows and letter displays, among other visual components, give users an interactive and interesting interface experience.
