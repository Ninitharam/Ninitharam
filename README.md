# HANGMAN GAME
Player thinks of a word in the word-guessing game Hangman, while the other player tries to guess it by offering letters. 
At first, the word is shown as a series of dashes, each dash denoting a different letter. A portion of a stick figure (the "hangman")
is drawn for each wrong guess. Attempting to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn is the task of the guessing player. 
The hangman is completed or the word is correctly guessed to signal the end of the game.
